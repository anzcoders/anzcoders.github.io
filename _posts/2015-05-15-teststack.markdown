session-title: Applying useful testing patterns using TestStack.Dossier

---
The Object Mother, Test Data Builder, Anonymous Variable/Value, equivalence class and constrained non-determinism patterns/concepts can help you make your tests more readable/meaningful, more terse and more maintainable when used in the right way.

This talk will explain why and where the aforementioned patterns are useful and the advantages they can bring and show examples in code using a library I recently released called TestStack.Dossier.
