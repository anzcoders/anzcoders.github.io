.NET has System.DateTime, JavaScript has Date - isn't that all I need? 

In simple cases, yes. But as soon as your application needs to deal with people and/or computers in different locations around the world (not to mention daylight saving) it may not be!

This talk will demonstrate some of the approaches you can make to better handle storing, comparing and displaying globally-aware dates and times both on the server/desktop and in the browser.
