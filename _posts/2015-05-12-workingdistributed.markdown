session-title: Working Distributed - How Does It Even Work?

---
I've been fortunate enough to work for a distributed team for the past 18+ months. But for developers or teams who are considering this option, what does this actually involve? How can you maximise your chances of success? How can you actually be productive and happy no matter where you are?

In this talk I'll cover a few topics that are near and dear to my heart:

* Actually being remote - is it really all about the lack of pants? 
* Timezones - are they really that bad? 
* Communications - can you be inclusive without drowning in noise? 
* Inter-personal stuff - have they synthesized the human touch yet? 
* Vision and strategy - how do you keep everyone on the same page?
