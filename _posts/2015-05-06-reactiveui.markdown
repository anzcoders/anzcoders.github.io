session-title: ReactiveUI - Itâ€™s Pretty Neat

---
ReactiveUI is an MVVM framework designed to write testable mobile and desktop applications in C#.

But I don't want to talk about just that. In this talk I will go through what functional reactive programming is, why you should care, the inspiration behind ReactiveUI and how to use Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI in your apps.
