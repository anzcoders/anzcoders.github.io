session-title: The Secret of Transactions and Async/Await

---
Did you ever ask yourself, when using async/await together with Entity Framework and transactions to load data from your database, what kind of black magic Entity Framework is pulling off behind the scenes? Or do you need to write custom code which participates asynchronously within a transaction? Together we explore the inner workings of transactions. We learn how to leverage transactions with asynchronous code and get to know why there is no way around async void when working with transactions. After this session there will be no more black magic.
