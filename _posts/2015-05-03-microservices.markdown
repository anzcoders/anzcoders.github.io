session-title: Microservice design patterns for line of business applications

---
So you broke up your big, unmaintainable monolithic system into microservices. Good for you. Each piece is now easy to understand and maintain. Except things didn’t get simpler. You’ve got lots of dependencies between your services to implement your business processes. You’re having to modify many services to change your processes and the complexity is exploding. This isn’t any better, if you can’t improve things you’re going back to the old way of doing things.

This talk discusses how you can use just three simple architectural patterns to design and implement microservice systems that can isolate the complexity of changes and support managing the evolution of business logic and processes over time. You will also learn how these design patterns can help deal with the distributed, non-transactional nature of microservice systems. As a bonus it includes other buzzwords like event sourcing and CQRS at no extra charge.

####About Colin####
Colin has been working with .NET since 2003 and has built and maintained systems for a variety of industries. He tends to focus on the backend in order to maintain a minimum safe distance from pixels (shiny or otherwise). Recently he has been accused of devops. He is currently working on a CQRS Event Sourcing microservices system built on Azure during which he's written a replacement for the Azure Emulator and considered rewriting all the other Azure tooling as well. He is a mostly recovered overengineering addict and is deathly allergic to PowerShell. Despite its presence in his talk title he doesn't actually like the word microservices, considering it pretentious. Limit 1 per customer.
