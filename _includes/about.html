                    <p>ANZ Coders is an interactive, online, virtual conference, running for 2 hours every night for a whole week. Being virtual means you won't need to ask the boss for time off work, you won't need to pay a conference fee and you can even show up in your pyjamas, pants optional. We won't tell anyone!</p>
                    <p>Attending is easy! When registrations open, just click the register button. That's it! You won't be asked to install any 3rd party software or browser plug ins. It's just you, a browser, a cool drink, a comfy seat and us. Sweet!</p>

                    <p>Each night will feature 3, 30 minute sessions with a 15 minute break between them. That'll give you time between sessions to collect your thoughts, check the tweets, take a bio-break, refill your drink, put the kids to bed, take the bins out and do whatever else you need to do.</p>
                    <p>Each session will have a live chat room and a Q&amp;A area. You'll be able to shoot the breeze with other attendees, ask the presenter questions as they go, or just do some friendly heckling just like an in person conference. How great is that?!</p>
