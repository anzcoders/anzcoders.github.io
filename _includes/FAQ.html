                    <h4>Where is it?</h4>
                    <p>It's virtual. It's online. It's wherever you are at the time. No need to worry about transport or parking for this conference.</p>
                    <h4>What's the cost?</h4>
                    <p>It's free! Zero. Nada. Nothing. Squat.<br />
                    Why? Because we love you. Awww. #hugs</p>
                    <h4>Will dinner be provided?</h4>
                    <p>No, but feel free to buy yourself a pizza and drop bits all over the floor at home if you want that full conference experience.</p>
                    <h4>When is registration open</h4>
                    <p>Now! <a href="http://www.crowdcast.io/e/anzcoders2015-1">Go register!</a></p>
                    <h4>How does voting work?</h4>
                    <p>Once sessions close we'll be putting all the abstracts up on UserVoice. The community (that's you!) will then have a few weeks to vote for the topics they most want to see. The top voted submissions will be asked to present and we'll work out the schedule and some session groupings and themes for you after that.</p>
