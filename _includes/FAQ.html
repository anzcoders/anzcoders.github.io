                    <h4>Where is it?</h4>
                    <p>It's virtual. It's online. It's wherever you are at the time. No need to worry about transport or parking for this conference.</p>
                    <h4>What's the cost?</h4>
                    <p>It's free! Zero. Nada. Nothing. Squat.<br />
                    Why? Because we love you. Awww. #hugs</p>
                    <h4>Will dinner be provided?</h4>
                    <p>No, but feel free to buy yourself a pizza and drop bits all over the floor at home if you want that full conference experience.</p>
                    <h4>When is registration open?</h4>
                    <p>Now! <a href="http://ccst.io/e/anzcoders2015">Go register!</a></p>
                    <h4>How does voting work?</h4>
                    <p>All the abstracts are up on UserVoice. The community (that's you!) will  have a week to vote on the topics they most want to see. The top community voted submissions will then be asked to present, and we'll work out the schedule after that.</p>

                    <h4>I want to speak!</h4>
                    <p>Wonderful! Sad to say, session proposals are now closed. If only you'd been a little more organised or heard about us earlier. #sigh</p>
                    <h4>I want to help!</h4>
                    <p>Great! Get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:contact@anzcoders.com">contact@anzcoders.com</a><br />
                    P.S. If you've got some graphical skills and want to spruce the site up, we'd love it. You can even submit a pull request. It's all <a href="https://github.com/anzcoders/anzcoders.github.io">open source</a></p>
                    <h4>I want to sponsor ANZ Coders</h4>

                    <h4>Is there a hashtag?</h4>
                    <p>Of course there is. Use #anzcoders</p>
                    <h4>Will recordings be available?</h4>
                    <p>Absoutely. We'll have all the links for you right here, once the conference is done.</p>
                    <h4>Do I have to behave?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, you do. Be nice, OK? That means no spamming, harassment, discrimination, racism or abuse. This includes speakers.</p>
